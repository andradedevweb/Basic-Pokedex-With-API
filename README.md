### About the project
I'm working on this project from a Pokedex using an external API, is a simple portfolio project to demonstrate my knowledge at the using external API's.

### How it works?

### There will be updates?
Yes, I'm currently working on a search system for the Pokemons and in the future I plan to add a description of each one.

### Usability 
* Know the different types of pokemons and their names
* Know your evolutions
* Be surprised by the amount of Pokemons there are
